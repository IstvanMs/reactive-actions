===============================================================================

ReactiveActions has been installed successfully!

Routes have been added to your config/routes.rb file:
  mount ReactiveActions::Engine, at: '/reactive_actions'

You can now access the reactive actions functionality at:
  http://localhost:3000/reactive_actions/execute

A sample action has been created at:
  app/reactive_actions/example_action.rb

You can try it out with:
  
  # Using HTTP
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/reactive_actions/execute \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"action_name": "example", "action_params": {"name": "YourName"}}'
  
  # Using JavaScript client
  ReactiveActions.execute('example', { name: 'YourName' })
    .then(response => console.log(response))

To create your own actions, add more files to the app/reactive_actions directory.
Each action should inherit from ReactiveActions::ReactiveAction and define
at least the `action` and `response` methods.
